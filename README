There are 100 bugs. I’m sorry.

Use Mongoose or something to run. Open index.html. Runs too slowly on the server.

INSTRUCTIONS: 

Match candies! Use the red door to go into the back areas of the factory. "Production" creates candy, "Coloring" colors candy, "sorting" puts candy in the game scene so that you can continue matching candies. 

thx: 

thx 2 clara for knowing all bout tile games and for some mad inspiration. thx 4 also fielding every absurd question i had about academic writing and existing at the game center so that i had a guide through the academic portion of this process.

thx 2 eric for your support of my dumb experimental ideas. i know i only visited with you once, but ur insight into polish and the student show installation were very helpful. 

thx 2 frank & matt for allowing me to make a game in the first place, even when i asked at the last possible moment

also specifically thx 2 matt for being a rlly gr8 teacher. i know so many things now and that’s mostly in part to u - like, i can program sort of and that’s amazing. also, i don’t think ur old and that u don’t know what memes are

also thx to bennett for sparking the idea that i didn’t have to just do game studies stuff and could maybe make games too

thx to the faculty generally. i wish i hadn’t been so timid so i could’ve spoken to u all more.

also, also, thx 2 rey, ansh, & duncan for talking all the fucking time, making me smarter person, and being supportive friends
